# K-Nearest-Neighbour-with-Material-Science
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms. KNN is used for predicting mechanical properties of cast aluminum alloys having temper grade Fabricared
Four Distance Calculation Methods 'Chebyshev','Euclidean','Manhattan' and 'Minkowski' are implimented and tested with diffrent number of neighbours.
